## About me

An avid Geographer, using Geographic Data Science "for good". Currently a Research Scientist at [Tracking California](https://trackingcalifornia.org/) at the Public Health Institute, focusing on spatial analysis and applications for public health and environmental justice across California — from dataset curation and creation to mapping tool development.

### Recent contributions

- Development of a statewide road network dataset detailing Vehicle Miles Traveled for California, including bespoke interpolation methodology deployed in Python
- Creation of various R Shiny apps for environmental justice purposes, including the Lithium Valley Data Explorer and soon-to-be published Community Air Quality Monitoring Data Explorer
- Development of household-level network Origin-Destination analysis for healthcare accessibility modelling
- More spatial analysis work forthcoming

### Previous experience

Previously a Lecturer in Geographic (and Social) Data Science at UCL, with teaching focusing on the ethics and politics of (geo-) data science, including the use of large-scale individual-level datasets, as well as principles of spatial analysis.

Doctoral research focused on creating innovative geospatial datasets from Call Detail Records for humanitarian and sustainable development applications, with a focus on social networks and community resilience.

Helped launch [The Missing Maps Project](https://www.missingmaps.org/) in the UK, leading large-scale training and mapathons in London and Southampton. Developed high-quality training material for mapathons, still in use by The Missing Maps to this day. Significant experience in the editing of OpenStreetMap, through both the visual interpretation and digitisation of satellite imagery and the importation of collected GPS tracks and waypoints.

Presented on behalf of The Missing Maps Project at the Royal Geographical Society and Oxford Internet Institute on the role of field data collection and mobile-based data collection apps.

Creator of an award-winning Geography Programming Bootcamp, teaching undergraduates the basic principles of Python programming for data analysis within GIS-based research.

Living in the San Francisco Bay Area since 2016.
