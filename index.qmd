Hi! I'm Jo.

::: {.intro}
You've stumbled on my website one way or another. A little about me? Well, I'm a long-term avid Geographer and Spatial Data Scientist who has spent the majority of their career figuring out how to use Geographic Data Science "For Good". For the last ten years, I've been based in the San Francisco Bay Area, enjoying everything California has to offer!

I'm currently a Research Scientist at [Tracking California](https://trackingcalifornia.org/) where I use GIS, spatial analysis, and data science to help with a range of community-based issues across public health and environmental justice in California. I spend my days doing everything from dataset curation and creation in Python, to creating new tools in R Shiny. More recently, I've spent time learning the ups and downs of vibe coding with Claude Code, and have a forthcoming tutorial book that you can find on my [Teaching](teaching.qmd) page.

Beyond these projects, I'm also working on **healthcare accessibility modelling in California** --- building household-level network Origin-Destination models to understand how communities access health services --- and on **detection of mobile homes** using geospatial methods to improve population and housing estimates across the state.
