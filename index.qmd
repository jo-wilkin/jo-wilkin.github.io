Hi! I'm Jo.

::: {.intro}
You've stumbled on my website one way or another. A little about me? Well, I'm a long-term avid Geographer and Spatial Data Scientist who has spent the majority of their career figuring out how to use Geographic Data Science "For Good". For the last ten years, I've been based in the San Francisco Bay Area, enjoying everything California has to offer!

I'm currently a Research Scientist at [Tracking California](https://trackingcalifornia.org/) where I use GIS, spatial analysis, and data science to help with a range of community-based issues across public health and environmental justice in California. I spend my days doing everything from dataset curation and creation in Python, to creating new tools in R Shiny. More recently, I've spent time learning the ups and downs of vibe coding with Claude Code, and have a forthcoming tutorial book that you can find on my [Teaching](teaching.qmd) page.

## Current work

- Statewide road network dataset for Vehicle Miles Traveled in California, with bespoke interpolation methodology in Python
- R Shiny apps for environmental justice, including the Lithium Valley Data Explorer and a Community Air Quality Monitoring Data Explorer
- Household-level network Origin-Destination analysis for healthcare accessibility modelling

## Previously

Lecturer in Geographic and Social Data Science at UCL, teaching spatial analysis, geocomputation, and the ethics and politics of data science. Developed and led three modules across undergraduate and postgraduate programmes.
