## Research interests

My research focuses on transport geography, urban mobility, and spatial data science. I am particularly interested in how spatial analysis and network methods can be applied to understand accessibility, travel behaviour, and urban systems.

### Key themes

- Transport and accessibility modelling
- Spatial data science and GIS methods
- Network analysis of urban systems
- Active travel and sustainable transport
